# Deep Learning for Quantum Chemistry

# Description
SchNet was introduced in 2017 by Schutt et al [[1]]. The authors have provided open-source code for their architecture, which will be our starting point as we attempt to
modify their implementation. The original architecture can be downloaded here: https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/SchNet. Note that you need to download and intall SchNet as described by the original authors. To see the performance of the modifications, replace the original schnet.py file with one of our modified files.
